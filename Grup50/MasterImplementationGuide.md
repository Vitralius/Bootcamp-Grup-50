## 💡 Pro Tips

### Implementation Best Practices:
1. **Read First**: Always read the full implementation guide before starting
2. **Test Frequently**: Test each system as you implement it
3. **Network Testing**: Always test features in multiplayer mode
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Keep an eye on entity counts and frame rates
5. **Documentation**: Update .md files as you make changes or improvements

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Don't skip NetworkObject components on new prefabs
- Always test with multiple players to ensure network sync
- Remember to add new prefabs to NetworkManager's prefab list
- Keep entity limits in mind for performance
