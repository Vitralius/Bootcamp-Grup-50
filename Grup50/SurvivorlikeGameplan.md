# Survivorlike Combat System Implementation Gameplan - Bootcamp Edition

## Project Overview
Transform our Unity multiplayer game into a **simplified Vampire Survivors-inspired survivorlike** experience for bootcamp development, integrating automatic combat mechanics with our existing character selection and networking systems.

## ⚠️ Bootcamp Constraints & Simplified Approach
**Key Decision**: Simple host-only multiplayer architecture for manageable bootcamp development.

### Architecture Research Findings (2024)
- **Full-scale survivorlike games** require complex distributed networking (400+ enemies)
- **Unity Netcode bottlenecks** occur with 90+ NetworkTransforms 
- **Vampire Survivors uses** distributed client ownership and 1Hz enemy sync
- **Bootcamp Solution**: Simplified host-authority with limited entity counts

### Simplified Multiplayer Architecture
- **2-4 players maximum** (not 8+)
- **Host handles everything**: Enemy spawning, damage calculation, wave management  
- **Clients send input only**: Movement, upgrade choices
- **Limited entities**: 30-50 enemies max, 20-30 projectiles max
- **Shorter sessions**: 10-15 minutes instead of 30
- **Basic progression**: 5-10 levels with simple upgrades

## Genre Analysis: Survivorlike/Bullet Heaven

### Core Mechanics (Simplified for Bootcamp)
- **Automatic Combat**: Characters auto-attack enemies without manual input
- **Movement-Focused Gameplay**: Player controls movement/positioning only
- **Time-Based Survival**: **10-15 minute sessions** with escalating difficulty
- **Wave-Based Enemy Spawning**: **2-3 enemy types** that increase in intensity
- **Basic Weapon System**: **3-4 weapon types** with simple upgrades
- **Experience-Driven Progression**: Level up by collecting XP from defeated enemies

### Key Appeal
- **Easy to Learn**: Simple movement controls, automatic shooting
- **Hard to Master**: Strategic positioning, upgrade choices, timing
- **Addictive Loop**: "Just one more run" progression system
- **Cooperative Potential**: Perfect for multiplayer survival scenarios

## Technical Architecture - Bootcamp Simplified

### Simplified Weapon System Architecture

#### Core Architecture Flow (Simplified):
```
AutoWeapon -> Simple Projectile -> DamagingObject -> HealthComponent
```

#### 1. **AutoWeapon.cs** - Simple Weapon Controller
- Basic timer-based automatic firing
- Spawns simple projectiles based on `WeaponData.cs`
- **Skip complex evolution** - just level-up stat increases

#### 2. **Simple Projectile System**
**Bootcamp Approach**: Start with one projectile type only
- **StraightProjectile** - Just moves forward and deals damage
- **Skip**: Orbiting, bouncing, area damage, homing for bootcamp

#### 3. **Reuse DamagingObject.cs** (Existing System)
Already supports everything we need:
- ✅ Layer-based targeting (Player/Enemy layers)
- ✅ Once vs continuous damage
- ✅ Network synchronization
- ✅ No additional coding needed

#### 4. **WeaponData.cs** - Simple Configuration
```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu]
public class WeaponData : ScriptableObject
{
    [Header("Basic Stats")]
    public float damage;
    public float fireRate;
    public float projectileSpeed;
    public GameObject projectilePrefab; // Uses existing DamagingObject
    
    // Skip complex behaviors for bootcamp
}
```

#### Bootcamp Weapon Types (3-4 maximum):
1. **Basic Gun** - Shoots straight projectiles
2. **Shotgun** - Shoots 3 projectiles in spread
3. **Rapid Fire** - Fast, low damage projectiles
4. **Optional: Area Weapon** - Uses existing area damage from DamagingObject

#### Benefits of This Design:
- ✅ **Reuses existing `DamagingObject.cs`** - no reinventing the wheel
- ✅ **Modular behaviors** - easy to add new projectile types
- ✅ **Layer-based targeting** - already works with Player/Enemy layers
- ✅ **Network compatible** - builds on networking foundation
- ✅ **Flexible damage patterns** - once, continuous, area, timed

### Simplified Network Architecture - Bootcamp
- **Host Authority**: Host handles everything (enemy spawning, damage, XP)
- **Client Input Only**: Clients send movement and upgrade choices
- **Simple Sync**: Basic NetworkObject spawning for enemies/projectiles
- **Entity Limits**: Cap at 50 enemies + 30 projectiles to prevent bottlenecks

### Bootcamp Performance Approach
- **Basic Object Pooling**: Simple pool for projectiles (not complex system)
- **Entity Limits**: Hard caps prevent performance issues
- **Reuse Existing**: Leverage DamagingObject.cs and HealthComponent.cs
- **Simple Collision**: Use existing collider setup, don't optimize yet

## Multiplayer Design Decisions

### Cooperative Survival Approach
- **Shared Arena**: All players in same survival area
- **Individual Progression**: Each player levels independently
- **Shared Enemies**: Enemy waves target all players
- **Revive System**: Players can help fallen teammates
- **Scaling Difficulty**: Enemy count scales with player count

### Character Selection Integration
- **Unique Starting Loadouts**: Each character begins with different weapons
- **Stat Variations**: Health, speed, damage multipliers per character
- **Visual Identity**: Maintain character mesh/appearance system
- **Balanced Diversity**: Ensure all characters remain viable

## Bootcamp Success Metrics
- **Functionality**: 2-4 players can play together for 10-15 minutes
- **Core Loop**: Auto-combat, enemy waves, XP collection, simple upgrades work
- **Character System**: Different characters have different starting weapons
- **Performance**: Stable gameplay with entity limits (50 enemies, 30 projectiles)
- **Bootcamp Goal**: Working survivorlike demo, not feature-complete game

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance**: Hundreds of networked entities
  - *Mitigation*: Object pooling, server culling, efficient collision
- **Network Sync**: Complex state synchronization
  - *Mitigation*: Server authority, client prediction, batched updates
- **Balance**: Multiplayer weapon/character balance
  - *Mitigation*: Iterative testing, data-driven tuning

### Design Risks
- **Complexity Creep**: Feature overload
  - *Mitigation*: Phased development, core loop first
- **Character Identity Loss**: Generic weapon system
  - *Mitigation*: Character-specific bonuses and starting loadouts
- **Multiplayer Chaos**: Too hectic with multiple players
  - *Mitigation*: Camera management, clear visual hierarchy
